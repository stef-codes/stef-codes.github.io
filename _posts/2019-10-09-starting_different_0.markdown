*> You got a dream… You gotta protect it. People can’t do somethin’ themselves, they wanna tell you you can’t do it. If you want somethin’, go get it. Period. — Christopher Gardner

  Taking the leap and starting Flatiron School is nowhere close to the most risky thing I’ve done. It’s that fact, that makes piling on a full-time bootcamp raise questions within myself and others.

  But, I’m doing it any way. I’m doing it, because I’ve wanted to attend a coding bootcamp since the first time I heard of one. And I never want to live with the regret of not starting and not trying. Career Karma came into my life at the perfect time and literally fast tracked the idea into full fruition. I’m starting this new chapter by jumping into the deep end without a life jacket. And I’ll feel the pull to stop multiple times throughout the day. Yet here we are: I started! And that means more than I’ll ever share. But, piece by piece I’m learning to share my story, protect my story, and protect my dreams.
