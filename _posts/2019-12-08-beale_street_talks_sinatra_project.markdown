I’m currently reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin. So, when it came time to create a project, I wanted to create around my life and passion for books. The project is named Beale Street.
This project allows users to add books to their personal bookshelf and view their bookshelf. I constantly find myself wanting to read books and forgetting which ones. So, this is a personal collection for users.

**Details**

Special thanks to Brian Emory for creating Corneal, which I used to get the necessary file structure for my application. The project can be found here on Github. It currently runs in your local environment. So, you must run ‘shotgun’ and navigate to http://localhost:9393/ to view the application. Once you do that you will see the welcome page.

Once you get to this page you can login or signup to create a new profile. The login tests that you entered something into both fields otherwise you’ll be asked to input valid data.
After you login you can see your bookshelf. If your bookshelf is empty you can add a book using the navigation bar. If you made a mistake, while adding your book don’t worry, you can edit the book information or delete the book and start again. After you’re satisfied with your list you can logout and trust your bookshelf is safe on Beale Street.
