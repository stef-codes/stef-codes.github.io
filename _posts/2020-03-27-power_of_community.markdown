This Flatiron journey is not without many ups and downs. We're placed into cohorts. However, it's our responsibility to be active and interact with the other people on this journey. 

One special thing are the BYOA(Bring your own anything) Zoom meetings we had organized by a member of our cohort. That allowed us to speak openly frustrations, joys, dreams, and other topics not covered in the curriculum. We spoke about the life we live behin the computer screen and beyond the code. For some they were just entering our cohort from another one and others have been in from the beginning and we hadn't had a chance to connect. But, it was definitely a turning point for all that attended.
